.SH NAME
mchedr2db \- collect and convert mchedr format bulletin
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBmchedr2db\fP [-v] [-A] [-p \fIpf\fP] [-a \fIauth\fP] [-f \fIfile\fP] db 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmchedr2db\fP converts mchedr format files distributed by the USGS into
css3.0 origin, and possibly arrival, tables.  Files could reside locally, 
or be collected from an ftp site.
.LP
This script was tested on the USGS mine and explosion data, but should
work on any mchedr format data.  See ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/mineblast/read_me
for additional information on this particular bulletin.
.LP
Files are retrieved from the remote ftp site and stored locally.  When this
script is run, file update times on the remote ftp site are checked against
the files that have been recovered and stored locally.  If the remote update 
time is newer than the stored file, the file is retrieved (replacing the previous
copy) and converted.
.LP
This is a new script that has not been rigorously tested.  I recommend 
that you treat it as experimental and note that it may have problems that
have not been uncovered in my simple testing.  Use at your own risk!  However,
if you find it useful and have suggestions for improvement, let me know and I 
will consider incorporating them in my next round of changes.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose output
.IP -A
Attempt to create arrival table if arrival information is available in input
file.  This was intended for use with the -f option, but should probably be successful
for files automatically downloaded. 
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Parameter file to use.  The default parameter file name is \fBmchedr2db\fP.
.IP "-a author"
Fill in the auth field in the origin (and optionally arrival table) with
this author.  The default is "mchedr".
.IP "-f file"
Do not retrieve files via ftp.  Instead convert the specified local mchedr format file: \fIfile\fP.
.IP db
Database that contains output origin and arrival information.  An attempt is made to
update any pre-existing origin or arrival information.
.SH FILES
Documentation of the mchedr format is found on the USGS web pages.  See for example:
ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/mineblast/read_me.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh and environment variable $PFPATH set.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Below is the default \fBmchedr2db\fP parameter file.

.LP
The user must define the type of bulletin they are collecting by naming the
instance of mchedr files to collect.  Each instance (i.e. current_exp and
monthly_exp above) must have the following parameters defined:
.LP
.IP file
Name of file to retrieve from remote ftp site.  This could be a regex that follows
perl conventions for pattern matching.  This is not thoroughly tested. 
.IP remote_host
Address of remote ftp site.
.IP remote_dir
Directory on remote ftp site where files reside.
.IP local_dir
Local directory where retrieved files are stored.  If it does not exist
it is created.
.IP author
Name to be used for the auth field in the origin (and optionally arrival) table.  
This can be overridden by the -a command line option.
.IP arrivals
If arrival information is available, create an arrival table.  Need to specify "yes" 
if you want arrivals collected.  The USGS currently has arrival information in
the mchedr bulletins for mines/explosions, but not in the mchedrexp.dat file which
contains the last 91 days of bulletin information.  I suggest you review a
file from the bulletin you wish to collect prior to using this program to see
if it has arrival information and then tune your pf accordingly. 
.SH EXAMPLE
#
# This section should contain an example that the user can follow
# verbatim.  For a command, this should show a sample command line and output.
# Use the same fonts as in \fBSYNOPSIS\fR. What the user types in should
# be bold, and program response or output should be roman. All commands 
# should be preceded by a representative UNIX prompt.
#
# For a library, you might show an example program (This is usually only 
# done for more complex routines or packages.)
#
.LP Generate a database from the mchedr0801ex.dat file producing both
an origin and arrival table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
Please consider using the \fBbulletin2orb\fP program instead of this one!  \fBbulletin2orb\fP
actually uses the netmag table.
.LP
This program has not been tested on any data other than the USGS mines and 
explosion data.  I suspect it will work on other mchedr data files, but I have
not confirmed this. 
.LP
This program is more verbose than necessary.
.LP
I have many stray in-house \fIblah2db\fP programs that I am trying to consolidate 
into a useful framework.  This program may disappear in the future as I move
toward a unified approach to bulletin collection.
.LP 
When creating arrivals, there are assumptions about the phase and what channel
it was picked on.  The mchedr does not specify a channel, so I impose the following 
mapping.  All "P" picks are mapped to "BHZ"; "S" picks are mapped to "BHN"; "LG" picks
are mapped to "BHN"; all others map to BHZ.
.LP
Magnitudes.  Sigh.  If the reported magnitude is ML or MB, the mapping is obvious.  If
the reported magnitude is LG, I chose to map this as an "mb" magnitude in the origin 
table.  For reported "MD" magnitudes I force the origin table to use "ml".  Other
magnitude types are not translated, but you might get an error message.  I have also
seen events in the mchedr files that have no reported magnitudes.  These are noted with
a message like: "Can't parse magtypes:     or      ".  I should probably broaden the
possible mapping of magnitudes or allow this to be customizable in the pf.
