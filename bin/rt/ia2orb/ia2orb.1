.SH NAME
ia2orb \- Acquire data from Internet Accelerometers into Antelope orbserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
ia2orb [-kvV] [-p pfname] [-s statefile] [-t target] [-c cmdorbname] orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBia2orb\fP utility acquires data from Internet Accelerometer (IA)
dataloggers via the Internet Accelerometer relay server, placing the acquired
data onto the Antelope orbserver specified by \fIorbname\fP. Files are converted
from the original miniseed into orb packets by the 
Antelope \fBminiseed2orb(1)\fP program, which is called automatically by \fBia2orb\fP. 

The stations to be acquired are specified by the \fIia_network\fP array in the 
parameter file. See the PARAMETER FILE section below for complete details. Each 
station may have acquisition specified as \fIoff\fP, \fIon-demand\fP, or 
\fIcontinuous\fP. If a station is marked for \fIcontinuous\fP acquisition, 
all files are downloaded from the instrument as they become available. If a 
station is marked for \fIon-demand\fP acquisition, files are downloaded only upon 
receipt of an acquisition command via the command-orb (usually put there by 
the \fBiatrigger(1)\fP or \fBiarequest(1)\fP applications), and only for files matching the 
requested point in time or time range for waveform data. The \fBia2orb\fP application
dynamically monitors its parameter file for changes to the \fIia_network\fP array, 
so the \fBia2orb\fP application does not need to be stopped and restarted if 
the status is changed for a given station. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c cmdorbname"
This is the name of the orbserver containing acquisition commands for 
\fBia2orb\fP. Packets of type \fI/pf/dlcm\fP on this orbserver (with 
the correct target name -- see the \fI-t\fP option below) will be 
interpreted as instructions to acquire on-demand waveforms. If this 
option is not specified, the command orbserver defaults to the name of the 
data orbserver (\fIorbname\fP) given on the command line. 

.IP -k
Keep the original miniseed files downloaded from the IA (rather than 
immediately erasing them after transfer to the orbserver).

.IP "-p pfname"
Specify a parameter-file other than the default \fIia2orb.pf\fP.

.IP "-s statefile"
Specify a state-file. If this option is invoked, information is saved about the 
last-acquired file from each station configured for continuous acquisition, such 
that upon restarting, \fBia2orb\fP will attempt to continue from where it 
left off with each continuous station. (Although note that the \fIreject_old_request_sec\fP
parameter in the parameter file -- see below -- takes precedence, so if the statefile
is too far behind, data before \fIreject_old_request_sec\fP will not be requested).

.IP "-t target" 
This is the \fBia2orb\fP instance name for commands delivered to the 
command orb. If not specified, the default is \fIia2orb\fP (i.e. the \fBia2orb\fP program
will be looking for orb command packets of the name \fIia2orb/pf/dlcm\fP on the command-orb).

.IP -v
Be verbose. 

.IP -V
Be very verbose.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
.SS "Parameter File Parameters"
.IP download_dir
This parameter specifies the directory into which miniseed files from the IAs 
will be initially downloaded. (Unless the -k option is specified, the downloaded
files will be erased after they are uploaded to the orbserver). 

.IP ia_network
This array specifies all available stations in the Internet Accelerometer Network. 
If a station does not appear in this list, it will not be acquired. There should be 
one line per station in this table. Seven whitespace-separated values appear on each line. The first 
is the name of the station, which must be unique. The second and third items are the 
network name and grid name for the station, respectively. The fourth and fifth elements 
give the relay server IP address and port number to use to connect to the station, respectively. 
The sixth element is a boolean value indicating whether to byte-swap the time-correction value in the 
acquired miniseed files from this station (accounting for a bug in some versions of the IA 
firmware). The final element indicates the acquisition mode for this station. If this value is 
\fIcontinuous\fP, continuous data are acquired from the given station. If \fIon-demand\fP, data are acquired
only in response to commands received by \fBia2orb\fP via the orbserver. If this value is \fIoff\fP, 
no data are acquired from this station. 

.IP ia_user
This parameter gives the *nix username with which to connect to the 
IAs through the relay server (the named user should exist on each 
IA. It's not a requirement, nor standard, that the same user exist on the 
relay server itself).

.IP max_rangerequest_sec
The \fBia2orb\fP program allows time-ranges of waveform data to be requested 
(via command packets placed on the command-orb) from all stations configured in 
\fIon-demand\fP acquisition mode (in the \fIia_network\fP
parameter-file array). The \fImax_rangerequest_sec\fP parameter 
specifies the maximum time-range of data, in seconds, that may be 
requested from on-demand stations via the \fIacqrange\fP command to \fBia2orb\fP. Requests for
time-spans of waveform data exceeding this length are summarily rejected by \fBia2orb\fP. 

.IP relay_server_ip
This is the Internet address of the Internet Accelerometer relay server, 
in dotted decimal notation. This parameter is not read directly by \fBia2orb\fP, 
rather it is a formatting convenience within the \fBia2orb\fP.pf parameter file. The 
\fIrelay_server_ip\fP parameter may be used as a plain reference (see the man-page 
pf(5) for more information on plain references) to fill in the rows of the \fIia_network\fP 
array, as demonstrated in the Parameter File Example below.

.IP reject_future_data_sec
This parameter specifies the number of seconds into the future (as judged 
by the system clock) beyond which data with future timestamps will be 
rejected rather than acquired onto the orbserver. If \fIreject_future_data_sec\fP is less than 0, 
all data are allowed. 

.IP reject_old_request_sec
This parameter specifies the number of seconds into the past beyond which data requests 
will be ignored by \fBia2orb\fP, whether coming from command-orb requests or from 
state-file notes. If \fIreject_future_data_sec\fP is set to 0, no filtering is performed. 

.IP scp
This is the name of the scp(1) executable invoked by \fBia2orb\fP, which can be just \fIscp\fP
if available on the local path (otherwise an absolute path should be specified).

.IP ssh
This is the name of the ssh(1) executable invoked by \fBia2orb\fP, which can be just \fIssh\fP
if available on the local path (otherwise an absolute path should be specified).

.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
The \fBia2orb\fP program may be run from the command line in a shell with 
an ssh authentication agent, for example as follows: 
.nf

% ssh-agent $SHELL
% ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_iauser
Passphrase:
% ia2orb -v ':@'

.fi

The following example shows how to trigger the acquisition of a segment of 
data across the network for a given time, by putting a command packet on the 
orbserver for the running \fBia2orb\fP instance using the default target name 
of \fIia2orb\fP:
.nf

%cat mycmd.pf
command acqnet
time 1177721659.872
% 
% pf2orb -s ia2orb -p dlcm mycmd :
%

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBia2orb\fP is strongly bound to the current naming convention and 
timestamping patterns for files on the IA dataloggers. Changes to these
conventions will invalidate data-acquisition assumptions made in the 
\fBia2orb\fP code. 

\fBia2orb\fP presumes the IA is configured to return time-series data in
counts, not in physical units.

\fBia2orb\fP presumes the account and shell under which it runs are already
authenticated for the ssh connections to the relay server. As a guideline 
only, one way to accomplish this when running from an interactive environment 
is by configuring an ssh agent:
.nf

% ssh-agent $SHELL
% ssh-add ./my_private_ssh_key_file
Passphrase:
%

.fi
The above example is only a guide to further exploration. The authentication
mechanisms for running \fBia2orb\fP (specifically, for running it continuously and 
in an automated sense under the Antelope real-time system) will have to be
constructed to match the security policies of the site at which \fBia2orb\fP
is run. The intent here is to have the security engineering for the user's ssh
connectivity be completely distinct from the internal engineering of the
\fBia2orb\fP program. For a few introductory suggestions on setting up password-less 
ssh logins, see the man-page ssh(5). For further information, consider referring to the
book \fISSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide\fP by Daniel J. Barrett, 
Richard E. Silverman, and Robert G. Byrnes, O'Reilly publications, 2005. 

\fBia2orb\fP is currently set up to use only one relay server per station. 
In principle it would be possible to expand it to use multiple relay servers, 
falling back to second or third relay servers on failure of the first. 

The \fIbyteswap_timecorr\fP capability was written as a workaround to a bug 
in the Internet Accelerometer acquisition code at the time of writing. It is no
longer necessary to enable this for all instruments. 

The -k option keeps the original files downloaded from the IA. However, 
if the \fIbyteswap_msd_timecorr\fP parameter is set, the byte-swapping is 
done in place on the files, so the files in the \fIdownload_dir\fP will 
be not quite identical to those on the IA itself.

\fBia2orb\fP will not repeatedly attempt to retrieve a given file from the IA if 
attempts to get that file are at first unsuccessful. The one exception to this is that 
if the file to be acquired is for a station in \fIon-demand\fP mode, if the failure 
to acquire is due simply to \fIscp\fP being unable to find or retrieve the file, and if the 
request time is within one \fIIA\fP block-size of the system-clock time, the relevant thread will
estimate an amount of time to sleep for that station, then re-post the request. This will hold off
requests for earlier data from the same station, however that data will still be requested after the 
sleep cycle elapses.
