.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBliss2orb\fP reads seismic data in LISS format from a \fIliss-server\fP
and sends it to an \fIorb\fP ring buffer.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-D raw"
write raw packets into file as they're received, for debugging.
.IP "-d db"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database \fIdb\fP.  (Since this information is not available from the
data feed, it has to be obtained from a static database; this database
can be generated using seed2db(1) and the corresponding dataless seed
volume from the IRIS DMC).
.IP "-m match"
Only packets with srcname containing the regular expression \fImatch\fP
are forwarded to the orbserver(1).
.IP -r
Use the local foreignkeys database to remap input net, sta, chan, and loc codes
to local sta and chan codes.  This makes orbmonrtd(1) and other programs which
don't recognize the loc code in the source name work better.
.IP "-s pktsize"
\fBliss2orb\fP attempts to derive the individual packet size by looking at
the size specified by the internal 1000 blockette.
However, some of these 1000 blockettes from certain servers are known to be wrong.
In this case, the user must explicitly specify the size of the incoming packets.
Currently, at least, all packets are
512 bytes, except for packets from the GT network, where packets
are all 256 bytes, and except for the IRIS DMC, which makes 4096 byte packets.  
.IP "-t timeout"
Specify a \fItimeout\fP on the read.  This should not be necessary.
.IP "-v"
Be more verbose, mentioning each packet copied.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Read data from an kono.iu.liss.org remote site.  Select data only for
BHZ, BHN, BHE channels and store them in a bbarray:9999 ORB.  Fill in
calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table of the database
asl.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The individual packets are SEED data blocks which
contain a blockette 1000.  This 1000 blockette should specify the
data block size, but currently (9/15/1999) some servers provide
blockettes with the wrong size.  In these cases, the size must be
derived from an explicit command line argument.
