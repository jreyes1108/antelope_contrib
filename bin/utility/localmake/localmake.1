.TH LOCALMAKE 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
localmake \- build subsections of the Antelope-contrib code base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
localmake [-v] [-l] [-p pfname] [-t] module
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBlocalmake\fP program is designed to build and install coherent
subsections of the Antelope contributed-code software base, usually to 
support the installation of one particular Antelope-contrib program or 
one particular Antelope-contrib software library or interface. 

If the \fBlocalmake\fP program is given a \fImodule\fP name, it will 
recompile all the parts of the specified \fImodule\fP (as detailed in 
the \fBlocalmake\fP parameter file) on which a particular software 
component depends. If the \fI-t\fP option is used, \fBlocalmake\fP will 
further assemble the resulting compiled components into a platform-specific
tar file which may be distributed for use on identically configured 
machines elsewhere. Depending on the components being compiled and how 
their makefiles are structured, the location into which results are 
installed may be $ANTELOPE/local rather than $ANTELOPE. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -l
Print a list of available modules and exit. 
.IP -v 
verbose
.IP "-p pfname"
Specify an alternate parameter file
.IP -t
Create a tarball of the compiled \fImodule\fP and files on which it depends
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP tarball_time_format
This parameter specifies the time format (in the format of epoch2str(3))
to be used in naming tar files with compiled code after it has been built. 
.IP modules
The \fImodules\fP array contains descriptions of all the software \fImodules\fP that 
\fBlocalmake\fP knows how to build and package. The keys in the array
should be unique, descriptive names for the software \fImodules\fP. The values 
are arrays with the parameters for how to build and package each \fImodule\fP. 
.IP "modules{<module_name>}{build}"
This parameter is a table of directories relative to $ANTELOPE containing the 
source code for the software \fImodule\fP and all of its dependencies (although 
if any of the directory names begins with a '/' character it is assumed to be 
an absolute path, and $ANTELOPE is not prepended). When 
\fBlocalmake\fP is told to build a given software package, it enters each of 
these directories in turn and executes 'make install'. 
.IP "modules{<module_name>}{package}"
This parameter is a table of files relative to $ANTELOPE containing 
all pieces of compiled code and supporting files comprising a given software
\fImodule\fP.

The package contents are actually a bit platform-specific, which is not 
yet accounted for. For example, dynamic libraries are named differently 
on Darwin than on Linux and Solaris. 

Inter-package conflicts and dependencies are not accounted for. 

The \fBlocalmake\fP.pf contents are highly detailed and contingent on insider 
knowledge of the piece of software being built. It is intended that these 
package descriptions be written by the author of the relevant piece 
of code. 

The \fBlocalmake\fP GUI will restart itself after compiling a module named
\fIbootstrap\fP. The \fIbootstrap\fP module allows the \fBlocalmake\fP
and \fBlocalmake_config\fP compilation facility easily updatable between 
official Antelope releases. 

\fBlocalmake\fP will sometimes report success in compilation even though it 
has failed somewhere along the line. This is due to an internal weakness in the 
way it spawns subsidiary make commands, a weakness which could be fixed but at a cost 
not yet allocated. Make sure to scan compilation output for evidence of errors (these 
should be fairly prominent in the colored-output when running \fBlocalmake\fP
as a GUI).
