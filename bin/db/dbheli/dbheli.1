.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbheli
makes a PostScript output file that contains a helicorder
style display of a single station-channel. The output file
name begins with \fBdbheli.\fP and ends with \fB.ps\fP and
is unique to avoid collisions with previously created PostScript
files.
.SS Command line arguments
.IP \fIdbname\fP
The name of the input database.
.IP \fIsta\fP
The station code.
.IP \fIchan\fP
The channel code.
.IP \fItstart\fP
The start time for the display.
.IP \fItwinline\fP
The time window for each line in the display in seconds.
.IP \fInlines\fP
The number of lines in the display.
.IP \fIscale\fP
The amplitude \fIscale\fP factor in data units per inch.
The data units are defined within the database and are
typically something like nm/sec.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-f filter"
A \fIfilter\fP specification. This \fIfilter\fP is applied to
the waveform before it is plotted.
The \fIfilter\fP specification is a character string like
"BW 0.1 5 1.0 5" which would be a 5 order butterworth filter
with a low corner frequency of 0.1 hz and a high corner
frequency of 1.0 hz. Note that specifications such as
this with embedded blanks must be quoted in the command line.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
no filtering is done.
.IP "-o dborigin"
The name of a database for displaying predicted event P-times.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
no predicted times are displayed.
.IP "-ps psfile"
The output PostScript file name.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
a unique PostScript file name is created by the program.
